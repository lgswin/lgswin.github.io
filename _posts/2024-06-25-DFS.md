Depth-First Search (DFS) is another fundamental graph traversal algorithm, which explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack data structure, either explicitly or implicitly with recursion. DFS is useful for many applications, including pathfinding, cycle detection, and topological sorting.

### DFS Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
    - Choose a starting node (source node).
    - Create a stack and push the source node onto it.
    - Mark the source node as visited.
2. **Traversal**:
    - While the stack is not empty:
        - Pop a node from the stack (let's call it `current_node`).
        - For each unvisited neighbor of `current_node`:
            - Mark the neighbor as visited.
            - Push the neighbor onto the stack.

### Pseudocode

Here is a simple pseudocode for DFS:

### Iterative Approach:

```
DFS(Graph, start_node):
    create a stack S
    mark start_node as visited
    push start_node onto S

    while S is not empty:
        current_node = S.pop()
        for each neighbor of current_node:
            if neighbor is not visited:
                mark neighbor as visited
                push neighbor onto S

```

### Recursive Approach:

```
DFS(Graph, current_node, visited):
    mark current_node as visited
    for each neighbor of current_node:
        if neighbor is not visited:
            DFS(Graph, neighbor, visited)

```

### Example

Consider the following graph:

```mathematica
   A
  / \
 B   C
 |   |
 D   E
  \ /
   F

```

If we start DFS from node `A`, the steps would be:

1. Push `A` onto the stack and mark it as visited.
2. Pop `A`, push its neighbors `B` and `C` onto the stack, and mark them as visited.
3. Pop `C`, push its neighbor `E` onto the stack, and mark it as visited.
4. Pop `E`, push its neighbor `F` onto the stack, and mark it as visited.
5. Pop `F`.
6. Pop `B`, push its neighbor `D` onto the stack, and mark it as visited.
7. Pop `D`.

The order of visited nodes could be: `A -> C -> E -> F -> B -> D`.

### Applications

- **Pathfinding**: DFS can be used to find a path from the source to the destination in a graph.
- **Cycle Detection**: DFS can detect cycles in both directed and undirected graphs.
- **Topological Sorting**: In a directed acyclic graph (DAG), DFS can be used to perform a topological sort.
- **Connected Components**: DFS can identify connected components in a graph.
- **Solving Puzzles**: DFS can solve puzzles like mazes, where you need to explore all possibilities to find a solution.
