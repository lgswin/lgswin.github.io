### 1. **Dockerfile**

A `Dockerfile` is a script that contains a set of instructions to create a Docker image. It defines the environment in which an application will run inside a container. The image built from the Dockerfile can then be used to create and run containers..

### **Dockerfile**

```
# 1. Specify the base image
FROM python:3.9

# 2. Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Copy the dependencies file to the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# 4. Install dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Copy application source code
COPY . .

# 6. Specify the command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `FROM` | Specifies the base image (e.g., `ubuntu:20.04`, `node:16`) |
| `WORKDIR` | Sets the working directory inside the container |
| `COPY` | Copies files from the local system to the container |
| `RUN` | Executes commands during the image build process (e.g., installing dependencies) |
| `CMD` | Specifies the default command to run when the container starts |
| `ENTRYPOINT` | Similar to `CMD`, but allows additional command-line arguments |
| `EXPOSE` | Declares the port the container will use |
| `ENV` | Defines environment variables |

### **2. docker-compose.yml**

A `docker-compose.yml` file is used to define and manage multiple containers as part of a single application. With `docker-compose up`, you can start multiple services at once.

### **Example docker-compose.yml**

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@db:3306/mydb

  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
      MYSQL_USER: user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  db_data:
```

### **Key Concepts of docker-compose.yml**

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `version` | Specifies the Docker Compose file version (e.g., `"3.8"`) |
| `services` | Defines the containers that will be run |
| `build` | Uses the `Dockerfile` to build an image |
| `image` | Specifies the Docker image to use |
| `ports` | Maps ports between the host and container (`host:container`) |
| `depends_on` | Ensures services start in a specific order |
| `environment` | Defines environment variables |
| `volumes` | Creates persistent storage |

### **3. Differences Between Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml**

| Feature | Dockerfile | docker-compose.yml |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | Defines how to build a container image | Manages multiple containerized services |
| Usage | `docker build`, `docker run`  | `docker compose up -d`, `docker compose down` |
| Functionality | Installs dependencies, sets up environment | Defines services, networks, and dependencies |

---

### **4. Example Usage**

### **1) Create a `Dockerfile`**

```
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### **2) Create a `docker-compose.yml`**

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@db:3306/mydb

  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
      MYSQL_USER: user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
```

### **3) Running the Containers**

1. **Start the containers using Docker Compose**
    
    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    
2. **Check running containers**
    
    ```
    docker-compose p
    ```
    
3. **Stop and remove containers**
    
    ```
    docker-compose down
    ```
